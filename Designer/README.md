# Level Designer
This is a GUI designed to give the user the ability to easily design new levels for the game. Instead of hard coding coordinates and hoping that the level will turn out aesthetically pleasing, this tool allows the user to visually place platforms, change the background color and change the size of the world in a very easy manner. All files are saved as '.stg' files and are saved in the 'levels' folder since that is where game.py looks for the levels. The goal is to make this tool responsible for controlling the creation of every aspect of a level such as: where enemies spawn, how much HP they have, where power ups would be placed and etc. For the time being it is only used to place platforms. Very soon the user will be able to customize their own platform and add it to the pre-existing list of platform types.

This GUI is being built using the Pyside library.
